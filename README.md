<h1>Bank Loan Management Report</h1>

<h2>Problem Statement: </h2>
Managing and analyzing loan portfolios is a critical task for financial institutions, particularly banks. With the increasing volume of loan applications, tracking key performance metrics, identifying risky loans, and ensuring compliance with financial goals has become challenging. Traditional methods of analyzing loan data often rely on static reports, which lack interactivity,  and granular insights. To address these challenges, the Bank Loan Management Dashboard Project aims to provide an interactive, dynamic, and comprehensive solution for visualizing and analyzing loan-related data. By leveraging Power BI, the dashboards offer interactive filtering, and detailed analytics across loan portfolios, enabling stakeholders to monitor, analyze, and optimize loan performance effectively.

<h4>Validation Process:</h4>
To ensure the validity and accuracy of reported KPIs, SQL Server was utilized for back-end data querying and KPI calculation. Key SQL snippets were employed to c:ross-verify metrics such as Total Loan Applications, Funded Amount, Received Amount, and Non-Performing Loan rates. This step ensures alignment between the Power BI dashboards and underlying database records, improving data accuracy and reliability.

<h2>Overview on Dashboards: </h2>
Our project on Bank Loan Management employs three interactive and fully dynamic dashboard pages, built using Power BI. By leveraging time intelligence, fields, and advanced visualizations, these dashboards provide an insightful summary, detailed overview, and in-depth analysis of loan-related metrics.
